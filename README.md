# Zania-AI-Challenge
Zania | AI Agent

Problem Statement
Create an AI agent that leverages the capabilities of a large language model. This agent should be able to extract answers based on the content of a large PDF document. Ideally, you use OpenAI LLMs. If you use the Langchain or LLama Index framework to implement this agentic functionality, please don’t use pre-built chains for the task. Implement the logic yourself. Please write production grade code as opposed to scripts as we will be evaluating your code quality.

Submission Guidelines
To submit your solution, please provide the following:
A link to your GitHub repository where you've hosted your code.
List all the ways you can make the solution more accurate
How you would have made your code more modular, scalable and production grade
A video or demo of your program in action.

User Journey:

The user will. input the PDF b. questions to answer c. ask the agent something like “Answer the questions and post results back on the CLI or web application..”
Supported Input File Types
Your application should support the following file types for input:
PDF
Input Requirements
You need to provide two inputs:
A list of questions.
A PDF file containing the document over which the questions will be answered.
Ideal Output Format
The output should be a structured JSON blob that pairs each question with its corresponding answer.
Answers should be word to word match if the question is a word to word match
If the answer is low confidence, reply with “Data Not Available”


Quality
Create high quality code as you would for a production model. Be mindful of writing a good readme, clean code, and so on.
